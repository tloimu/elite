Helps plotting long and mid-range exploration routes when trying to find new discoveries. Install the .act file into the **EDDiscovery/Data/Actions** directory and enable it in EDDiscovery's Add-on Manager (Menu *Add-ons* -> *Manage Add-Ons* -> click Enable-checkbox on the *First Discovery* plugin).
